# The Manifesto

## What is MT?

MT stands for **Maker's Territory**. This is a sandbox for folks to try out experiments and Make fun stuff.

## What is CX?

CX stands for **Creative eXploration**. It can also stand for building **Cool eXperiences**.

## What do you Make?

The idea is to create a safe space for exploring territories or practices that are not really considered as the ideal by field. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a website using some archaic language that was never meant to build a website. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a programming language that is not meant to scale. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a fun app that nobody uses. It can be anything and doesn't need to be confined to just tech.

It can be anything.

The idea is to build, create, produce, manufacture, **Make**.

Let the world laugh at your ideas or your creation. It doesn't matter. The goal is to not stop Making.
