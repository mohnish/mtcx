# The Manifesto

## What does MT stand for?

MT stands for **Makers Territory**. This is a sandbox for **Makers** to try out experiments and **Make** fun stuff. You could *Write, Knit, Hack, Build, Create, Compose, Invent*. You are **Making**.

## What does CX stand for?

CX stands for **Creative eXploration**.

## What does MTCX stand for?

**MTCX** stands for a safe space to encourage **Makers** to explore their creativity.

## What do you Make?

The idea is to create a safe space for creative exploration. Your exploration may not necessarily be considered as ideal by others. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a website using some archaic language that was never meant to build a website. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a programming language that is not meant to scale. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a fun app that nobody uses. It doesn't matter if you **Make** an ugly desk. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a sweater that doesn't fit. It doesn't matter if you **Make** a new Wheel.

It can be anything.

The idea is to build, **Create**, **Build**, **Produce**, **Manufacture**, **Write**, **Knit**, **Hack**, **Build**, **Create**, **Compose**, **Invent**. **Make**.

Let the world laugh at your ideas or your creation. It doesn't matter. The goal is to not stop **Making**.
